# SocketTrack

Tracking with WebSocket and pywebsockets

## Setup

Install requirements: 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## What is this?

This is just a simple project to allow one to collect access data for sites. For example, import the js file, invoke the function, and now you can track. 

At the moment, this doesn't do anything too crazy. It's simply sends the current `document.location.pathname` via a WebSocket message. The rest of the data is obtained just by the WebSocket reqest headers.

This will output the following in terminal (also logged):

```
---NEW CONNECTION---
[+]Connection from:  192.168.2.54
[+]Origin:  http://192.168.2.62:9000
[+]Path:  /files/example.html
[+]User-Agent:  Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 14_2 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/14.0.1 Mobile/15E148 Safari/604.1
---END CONNECTION---
```

**Why would I want this?** I don't know. You never know when you'd want to see where traffic is coming from. This is also relatively benign; a single message sent to the server and then the connection is closed. 

## SSL Notes


It's recommended to use ssl on the SocketTrack endpoint/websocket server. In this case, we're using a reverse proxy via nginx and let's encrypt. 

```
location /sockettrack/ {
    proxy_pass â€‹http://127.0.0.1:8080;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
}
```

Be sure to change the `ws.js` file if moving to SSL!

From: 

```
var ws = new WebSocket("ws://SERVER_URL/sockettrack");
```

To: 

```
var ws = new WebSocket("wss://SERVER_URL/sockettrack");
```
